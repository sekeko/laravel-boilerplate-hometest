## Laravel Boilerplate (Current: Laravel 8.*) 

### Install steps

#### Environment Files
This package ships with a .env.example file in the root of the project.

You must rename this file to just .env

Note: Make sure you have hidden files shown on your system.

#### Composer
Laravel project dependencies are managed through the PHP Composer tool. The first step is to install the depencencies by navigating into your project in terminal and typing this command:

```console
composer install
```

#### NPM/Yarn
In order to install the Javascript packages for frontend development, you will need the Node Package Manager, and optionally the Yarn Package Manager by Facebook (Recommended)

If you only have NPM installed you have to run this command from the root of the project:

```console
npm install
```

If you have Yarn installed, run this instead from the root of the project:

```console
yarn
```
